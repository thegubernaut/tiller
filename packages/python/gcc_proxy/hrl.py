"""HRL — the deterministic meta-level controller (token-free by construction).

Numeric state + fixed transition rules. Deterministic, pure, replayable.
The public surface accepts finite floats only and raises on anything
text-like: there is no code path by which a prompt can steer the controller.
Injection resistance of the controller is a property of the wiring, not of a
filter. (The arbiter downstream is text-exposed by necessity; its compliance
with the commanded posture is a measured property, never an assumption.)

Extends the public blueprint (thegubernaut/Gubernaut_Validation, blueprint/
governor_skeleton.py) with the full telemetry triple
{intensity, valence, repetition}: the
perseveration channel is driven by the explicit repetition signal rather than
inferred from repeated hostile drive.
